# hello-world
Hello, my name is Chris. I like to experiment with IOT by means of arduino boards. Currently I am planning control of Arduino with the Blynk application to control my solar panel systeem and home burglar alarm system (IOT) and the parameters of my motorbike shown on smartphone while driving slowly;) (bluetooth)
As soon as the projects are running and tested I will share the arduino sketches with comment. Just give me a couple of months.
Blynk and Cayenne are awesome applications; deep respect for the makers.
